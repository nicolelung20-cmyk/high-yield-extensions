# CC_GodMode Quick Start Guide

> **Version:** 8.6.0

## Daily Usage — Two Steps

Each session, two steps unlock the full parallel-first system:

**Step 1 — Turn on Ultracode** (session-scoped; set it once per session via the effort selector at
the bottom of Claude Code, or by command):

```
/model best        # Opus 4.8 today; auto-upgrades as higher tiers unlock
/effort ultracode  # xhigh reasoning + automatic parallel dynamic workflows
```

**Step 2 — Type `GodMode:`** followed by your request:

```
GodMode: New Feature: user profile page with avatar upload
GodMode: Bug Fix: login button unresponsive on mobile
GodMode: Research: best state management for React 18 in 2026
```

No elaborate role prompts needed — the orchestrator reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically when Claude Code
starts in your project. Ultracode is the one thing that does **not** persist across sessions, so make
Step 1 a habit; without it GodMode still orchestrates, just at lower parallel width. The trigger
`GodMode:` is case-insensitive (`GODMODE:` works too).
